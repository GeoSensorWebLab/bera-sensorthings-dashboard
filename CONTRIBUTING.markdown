## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a feature or way for the dashboard to be improved, you can add it to the project's [Issue Tracker][Issue Tracker].

1. First check the Issue Tracker for any existing feature requests that match yours. If it exists, you can add a comment or vote to note your interest.
2. If an existing issue doesn't exist, create a new one for the "Simple STA Dashboard" project.
3. For a Feature Request, I recommend you use the "Task" or "Story" issue type. Then fill in the remaining fields that make sense to you.
4. Once you submit the issue, the project team will review it and work with you to fit it in the project scope and schedule.

## Bug Reports

If you found an unexpected or unwanted behaviour in the dashboard, please report it on the project's [Issue Tracker][Issue Tracker].

1. First check the Issue Tracker for any existing bug reports that match yours. If it exists, you can add a comment or vote to note your interest.
2. If an existing bug report doesn't exist, create a new one for the "Simple STA Dashboard" project.
3. For a Bug Report, use the "Bug" issue type. Then fill in the remaining fields that make sense to you.
4. Once you submit the issue, the project team will review it and work with you to narrow down the cause and find a fix.

## Patches/Merge Requests
